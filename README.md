This Chrome extension will make an ad turn green and say "Ad Viewable" once it is recognized as viewable.

Currently it is restricted to ads delivered through DFP, though has some edge cases like inline Adsense and specific header bidding configurations with OpenX that causes the ad to not be detected as viewable. Working on that.
